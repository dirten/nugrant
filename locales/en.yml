          Nugrant: Parameter '%{key}' was not found, is it defined in
          your .vagrantuser file? Here where we think the error
          could be in your Vagrantfile:

          %{context}

          If you think it should be found, don't hesitate to fill an
          issue @ https://github.com/maoueh/nugrant/issues.
