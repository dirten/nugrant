          Nugrant: Parameter '%{key}' was not found, is it defined in
          your .vagrantuser file? Here where we think the error
          could be in your Vagrantfile:

          %{context}

          If you think it should be found, don't hesitate to fill an
          issue @ https://github.com/maoueh/nugrant/issues.

        parse_error: |-
          Nugrant: Vagrant user file could not be parsed correctly,
          the file is probably in an invalid state.

           File: %{filename}
           Error: %{error}

          If you think this is an error, don't hesitate to fill an
          issue @ https://github.com/maoueh/nugrant/issues.
